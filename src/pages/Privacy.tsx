            Saralya is not a lender. Saralya Tech Solutions Private Limited builds and operates this app. Loans are
            offered, sanctioned and disbursed by the RBI-regulated entity whose name and registration number are shown
            to you inside the app before you accept any offer. That entity, not Saralya, decides your application and
            holds your loan.
